Founder with a computer science background, focused on building and scaling B2B SaaS products.
I care about solving real problems at the intersection of technology, product, and go-to-market, and I enjoy turning messy workflows into simple, usable systems.

## TalentSight 
[TalentSight](https://talsight.com) is a B2B SaaS platform helping recruiting teams automate and scale LinkedIn outbound without losing control or authenticity.

Built and scaled the product from idea to 6-figure ARR in 2 years
This has been my main professional focus over the past years and the place where I combined engineering thinking with customer-facing problem solving.

## Personal Projects
Projects I built to explore ideas, learn by doing, and solve concrete problems.
