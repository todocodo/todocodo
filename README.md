Welcome to my profile! I'm a graduate student, and I have a passion for solving problems. Coding happens to be my way of expressing that ⚡. I love sports, people, sea, clubs and pizza. I love life. 

## Recent Projects 
Those are the most recent projects that seek to fix some of the world's problems.

- AI Tourist Advisor Chatbot -> check the [repo](https://github.com/todocodo/Tourist-Advisor-Chatbot) in my account
- The Nutritionist - A website that assists people with obesity providing advice in terms of personalised diet and providing a friendly environment -> check the [repo](https://github.com/todocodo/WeightLoss-Web)

## Business Projects
Those businesses helped me in earning money on my own during university. I'll never forget the invaluable lessons I gained.

- Shish Delivery Business in my university town - check the [website](http://shishaguildford.com) and the [repo](https://github.com/todocodo/React_Website_Shisha)
- Karate Referee Recogniser - check the [DEMO](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6943497225213767680/) of the system. Because it is being used for a startup project, the code for that system is kept confidential.
